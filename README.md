# Snake-Game-Python-
This is a Simple Classic game (snake) which is built with the help of the Pycharm module of the Python Programming Language

## Code Architecture
Built in an object oriented fashion . Snake is built using small squares of equal size .  and the playing area is a grid of squares. The grid squares are just a tiny bit larger than the squares used to built the snake. 
* Reset functionality is given. Whenever we make a move that tries to collide the snake head with its body , a message box appears
showing game over and asks the user if he/she want to play again.
